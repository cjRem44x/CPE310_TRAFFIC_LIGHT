# Traffic Light Controller Project (Educational)

This is an educational project developed for CPE310 that demonstrates basic embedded systems programming using Assembly language on an ATmega328P microcontroller.

## Educational Purpose

This code is intended for learning purposes and demonstrates:
- Basic Assembly programming for AVR microcontrollers
- Digital I/O control
- Timing and delay implementations
- Traffic light state machine logic

## Project Overview

The project implements a basic traffic light controller that manages:
- North-South (NS) traffic signals
- East-West (EW) traffic signals

Each direction has three lights (Red, Yellow, Green) controlled via Port D pins.

## Technical Details

- Target Platform: ATmega328P
- Programming Language: AVR Assembly
- Pin Usage: Port D (PD1-PD6)
